# üçî Swiggy Clone - React + Redux App

A fully functional Swiggy-like food delivery web application built using **React.js** and **Redux** for state management. This app fetches real-time restaurant and food data from the Swiggy public API and allows users to browse, filter, and add items to their cart with a smooth and snappy experience.
